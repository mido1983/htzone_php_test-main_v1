Composer (PHP's package manager)
Install Composer:

Download the Composer Windows Installer from https://getcomposer.org/download/
Look for "Composer-Setup.exe" and download it
Run the installer
During installation, make sure to let it add PHP to your PATH if prompted

Verify Installation:
After installation, open a new PowerShell or Command Prompt window and run:
```bash
   composer --version
```
If Still Not Working:
Make sure PHP is installed and in your PATH
You might need to restart your terminal/PowerShell
You might need to restart your computer
Once Composer is Working:
Then you can run:   
```bash
    composer install
```
This will install the dependencies defined in your composer.json file, including the vlucas/phpdotenv package that your Database class is using.
